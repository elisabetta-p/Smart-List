## See the project
You can see and use the project (remember that it's a work in progress) here: [Smart-List](https://elisabetta-p.github.io/Smart-List/). 
It's only optimized for desktop right now - not for mobile.
As of today August 2nd, the only login check is that bot the username and the password need to be between 3 and 32 characters, and there is no data persistency as there is no backend.
